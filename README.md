# image-manipulator
a source code of an image manipulator that can be used to edit and crop images at ease.
### the web version source is better and only to be used on PC, it's designed as experimental only and it's front end is kinda broken but alr.
- use the py version instead.
- i mainly do backend / scripting so idk front-end much, ignore all that shit lwl :3 >~<
